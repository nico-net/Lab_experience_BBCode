### Day 3 (2026-05-23): Parameter table [n, k, d]_4

Computed n and k from the rank of H over F_4 (already reported on Day 2).
For the `tiny` (3,3) instance, brute-forced d by encoding all 4^10 = 1,048,576 F_4-messages against the codeword basis and minimising Hamming weight over nonzero codewords.
For `small`, `medium`, and `large` we report an upper bound on d:
the minimum across (a) basis row weights, (b) a complete enumeration of weight-1, weight-2, and weight-3 messages over F_4*, and (c) 200,000 random messages drawn uniformly from F_4^k (seed 20260523).

Results:

```
name    (ell,m)       n  rank    k    rate     d_4  method
----------------------------------------------------------
tiny    ( 3, 3)     18     8   10  0.5556       6  exact
small   ( 6, 6)     72    30   42  0.5833     ≤ 6  upper_bound
medium  ( 9, 6)    108    50   58  0.5370     ≤ 6  upper_bound
large   (12, 6)    144    68   76  0.5278     ≤ 4  upper_bound
```

Rationale: the brute-force d is the only value defended for `tiny`; for larger codes the literature-standard practice (Bravyi 2024 used MIP) is unavailable in the project budget, so we report an upper bound and explicitly mark it `≤`. The upper bound is the only value the paper claims; tightening it is future work and is *not* on the critical path because the decoder threshold is set by FER curves, not by d.

Validation: every reported value satisfies basis_min_weight ≥ d (consistency), rate matches k/n exactly, and the row/col weights stay at the Day 2 values of 6/3, confirming H was not mutated.

Outcome: Parameter table ready for paper Section III.
