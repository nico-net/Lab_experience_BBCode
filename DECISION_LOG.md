# Technical Decisions Log

**Purpose:** Record every technical choice with date and rationale. Essential for writing Methods section and for debugging.

**Format:**
YYYY-MM-DD: [Decision]
Rationale: [Why this choice]
Alternatives considered: [What else was possible]
Outcome: [Did it work? Update later if needed]

## Phase 0: Setup

### 2026-XX-XX: Project created
Rationale: Maintain persistent context across 4-week sprint, enable efficient code review
Outcome: [TBD]

### 2026-XX-XX: Chose Analog 3 + Section VII approach
Rationale: Clean GF(4)-linear construction for 1-month timeline; quantum connection via structural bridge; clear path to extension paper
Alternatives considered: Analog 2 (CRSS additive code - too complex for timeline), Analog 1 (binary - throws away GF(4) framing)
Outcome: [TBD]

## Phase 1: Code Construction

### Day 1 (2026-21-5): GF(4) representation

Decision: Encode a + b·ω as the uint8 integer (b<<1)|a, so {0, 1, ω, ω²} ↔
{0, 1, 2, 3}. Addition implemented as bitwise XOR. Multiplication and
inversion implemented via precomputed 4×4 and length-4 lookup tables.

Rationale:
- Addition is free (single XOR), matching characteristic-2 structure.
- The full multiplication table has only 16 entries; lookup is faster than
  any algebraic shortcut at this size, and trivially vectorizes over NumPy
  arrays of arbitrary shape. The same uint8 dtype carries through to the
  parity-check matrix and decoder message tensors with no conversions.
- Trace reduces to extracting the high bit (Tr(x) = (x >> 1) & 1), so the
  CRSS trace inner product on Section VII can be computed with a shift.

Alternatives considered:
- Log/antilog tables with base ω: clean for multiplication but makes
  addition awkward (needs Zech logarithm or fallback to representatives).
  Rejected because BP and Metropolis are addition-heavy.
- Symbolic representation via SymPy or galois package: rejected for
  inner-loop performance; we want uint8 NumPy arrays end-to-end.

Outcome: gf4_lib.py passes all 11 unit tests including the brief's
validation gf4_mul(ω, ω) == gf4_add(ω, 1). Ready for Day 2.
